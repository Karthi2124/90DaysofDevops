### Day-22: Getting Started with Jenkins

#### ✅ Task 1: What is Jenkins?

Jenkins is an open-source automation tool used in the DevOps lifecycle to build, test, and deploy code continuously. It helps automate repetitive tasks, reducing manual errors and speeding up the delivery process. Jenkins integrates with tools like Git, Docker, and Maven using plugins, enabling seamless Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).
